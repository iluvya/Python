# Python
Collection of my python scripts

## Description
I consider myself as a system programmer and try to get in computers as deep as possible.  
But i can do a little bit of python and often do it in my work to automate a routine tasks or just for fun.  
Would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient.  
Hope someone could find any useful lines of code and implement it in one's projects.
